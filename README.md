# The Cakery Bakery

The Cakery Bakery is a fun and interactive cake-making game where players rush against time to complete cake orders. The interface consists of plates passing by on a conveyor belt, and the player will have to drag the correct cake base, frosting flavor, and toppings onto it to construct cakes according to the current customer's order. There will only be a limited time before the plate disappears off the screen, so the player must be quick. In addition, the conveyor belt will speed up as the game progresses in difficulty. In terms of score, the player collects points for every correct order. The player also has a total of three lives, which will be lost if an incorrect cake is made or an order is missed.
